# Concerto

## What is Concerto

Concerto is a Web 2.0 application written in React (front-end) and Node (back-end).


## Software

Concerto is built using:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)


## Start up

To start the backend go to the /backend directory and run following commands:
```
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

To start the frontend go to the /frontend directory and run following commands:
```
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
Ideally you should start the backend before the frontend, otherwise there is no data to use.
